Important Security and Reliability Checklist While Building Or Consuming an API

In the following section some key considerations are important to make sure the API that is being built or consumed is secured and reliable: 

1. Authentication and Authorization
API consumers should be authenticated and authorized by using OAuth2, API keys or JWT tokens so that access to some of the endpoints is given only to a select few.

2. Data Validation
Injection attacks like SQL injection, XSS can be avoided by sanitizing data and validating inputs. 

3.Validation frameworks like JSR-303 can be utilized to request validation.

4. Rate Limiting
Fair use of the API can be ensured by employing rate limiting for petitons by implementing tokens or request quotas, hence preventing abuse of the API.

5. Error Handling
Utilize standard HTTP status codes 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error to explain users the exact issues hence providing users with informative error messages. 
 
6. Data Encryption 
Better protection against eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks can be achieved by encrypting data in use with HTTPS on the network. 
Encryption can also be used on physical data like passwords.
