1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
 To solve this problem first I need to read the data from CSV file, and then with
 including cell no I have used  Maps in Java I will store all the data in map 
 and used variables to track the cell no after we had resolved all
 dependencies of value in the map then with the help of a print writer in Java i will
 create the new output file and print the output in that CSV file.

2. What type of errors you would you check for?
there are mainly two types of runtime exception
1. Input format errors 
2 .Formula parsing errors
3. Arthamitc error reference
4. Invalid cell reference
5. Circular reference 

3. How might a user break your code?
1. By providing invalid cell reference 
2. By providing the invalid inputs 
3. By Providing the invalid formulas 
4. By Circular reference cells or invalid cells.
5 By Providing the large input data which can't be hold
6 By Providing the Case sensitive cell references.
